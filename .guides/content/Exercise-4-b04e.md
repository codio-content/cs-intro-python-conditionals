## Conditionals Exercise 4

**Problem**
Use the variable `x` as you write this program. `x` will represent a string. Write a program using the `elif` keyword that determines if `x` is a primary color (red, blue, or yellow). If yes, print `_ is primary color`, where the blank is the value of `x`. If no, print `_ is not a primary color`, where the blank is the value of `x`.

**Expected Output**
* If `x` is `red`, then the output would be: `red is a primary color`.
* If `x` is `teal`, then the output would be: `teal is not a primary color`.


**Important**
The variable `x` is already declared for you. Please **do not** modify the code on lines 5 and 6.

{try with x = 'red'}(python3 code/selection/exercise4.py red)
{try with x = 'teal'}(python3 code/selection/exercise4.py teal)
