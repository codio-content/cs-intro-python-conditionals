## Conditionals Exercise 2

**Problem**
Use the variable `x` as you write this program. `x` will represent a positive integer. Write a program that determines if `x` is divisible by 5. If yes, print `_ is divisible by 5`, where the blank is the value of `x`. If no, print `_ is not divisible by 5`, where the blank is the value of `x`.

**Expected Output**
* If `x` is `50`, then the output would be: `50 is divisible by 5`.
* If `x` is `37`, then the output would be: `37 is not divisible by 5`.


**Important**
You will need to declare the variable `x` as you write and test your code. However, do not submit your code to be graded with the variable declaration. The auto-grader will declare the variable for you.
