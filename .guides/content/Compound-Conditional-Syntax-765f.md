## Compound Conditional Syntax

A compound conditional is a conditional (an if statement) that has more than one boolean expression. You need to use the `and` or the `or` keywords to link these boolean expressions together. You can use the `not` keyword, but only in combination with `and` or `or`.

```python
if True and True:
    print("True")
```

## What happens if you:
* Have an if statement that says `if True or False:`?
* Have an if statement that says `if not True or False:`?
* Have an if statement that says `if True not False:`?
* Have an if statement that says `if 5 < 10 and 5 > 0:`?

<details><summary>**Compound Less Than or Greater Than**</summary>This is Python specific syntax, but it is possible to combine a compound conditional to look like something from a math class. Imagine you have a variable `a` with the value of `5`. You can rewrite `a < 10 and a > 0` to be `0 < a < 10`.</details>
