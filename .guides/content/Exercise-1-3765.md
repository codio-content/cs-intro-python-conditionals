## Conditionals Exercise 1

**Problem**
Use the variable `x` as you write this program. `x` will represent a positive integer. Write a program that determines if `x` is between 0 and 25 or between 75 and 100. If yes, print the message:`_ is between 0 and 25 or 75 and 100`, where the blank would be the value of `x`. The program should do nothing if the value of `x` does not fit into either range.

**Expected Output**
* If `x` is `8`, then the output would be: `8 is between 0 and 25 or 75 and 100`.
* If `x` is `80`, then the output would be: `80 is between 0 and 25 or 75 and 100`.
* If `x` is `50`, then the output would be blank (your program does not print anything).


**Important**
You will need to declare the variable `x` as you write and test your code. However, do not submit your code to be graded with the variable declaration. The auto-grader will declare the variable for you.

<details><summary>**Type Casting**</summary>Use the `str(x)` command to type cast the variable `x` as a string.</details>
