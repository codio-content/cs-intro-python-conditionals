## Conditionals Exercise 1

**Problem**
Use the variable `x` as you write this program. `x` will represent a positive integer. Write a program that determines if `x` is between 0 and 25 or between 75 and 100. If yes, print the message:`_ is between 0 and 25 or 75 and 100`, where the blank would be the value of `x`. The program should do nothing if the value of `x` does not fit into either range.

**Expected Output**
* If `x` is `8`, then the output would be: `8 is between 0 and 25 or 75 and 100`.
* If `x` is `80`, then the output would be: `80 is between 0 and 25 or 75 and 100`.
* If `x` is `50`, then the output would be blank (your program does not print anything).


**Important**
The variable `x` is already declared for you. Please **do not** modify the code on lines 5 and 6.
