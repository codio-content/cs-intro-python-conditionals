## Elif Statement

The if statement asks a single question, "Is this true?". The if else statement asks two questions, "Is this true, or is this false?". The elif statement is used after an if statement and before an else statement. Elif statements give you more precision when making decisions.

```python
grade = 82

if grade < 70:
    print("You got an F.")
elif grade < 80:
    print("You got a C.")
elif grade < 90:
    print("You got a B.")
else:
    print("You got an A.")
```
